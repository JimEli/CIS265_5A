# Pima CC CIS265 Week 5 Project A

Write a program that reads a 5 x 5 array of integers and the prints the row sums and the column sums:
```text
   Enter row 1: 8 3 9 0 10
   Enter row 2: 3 5 17 1 1
   Enter row 3: 2 8 6 23 1
   Enter row 4: 15 7 3 2 9
   Enter row 5: 6 14 2 6 0 
   Row totals: 30 27 40 36 28
   Column totals: 34 37 37 32 21
```
Notes:
*  Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141), using C language options.
*  Row entry numbers are delimited by the non-digit characters.
*  No attempt is made to validate the integer input.
*  MS version uses secure strtok_s.
